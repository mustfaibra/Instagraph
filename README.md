# Instagraph
Instagraph is an Instagram Clone which I am practicing on a new concepts and other advanced Jetpack compose specific concepts.

The clone only contains the main screens of the original app, like :
- Splash
- Login As
- Home
- Search
- Notifications
- Chats 
- Profile

But it should be enough to cover almost most of the concepts that you need to learn about Jetpack compose! ü§© .

In this app, I used the following :

1. MVVM architecture 
2. Jetpack Compose for UI
3. CompositonLocalProvider
4. State management
6. Compose Navigation
6. Compose animations
7. Lottie animations
8. Launched Effect
9. Coroutines
10. Hilt for Dependency Injection
11. Timber for logging
12. Accompanist PagerView for post images
13. Accompanist PlaceHolder to show loading effect "Shimmer"

Please don't forget the stars amigo ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
